            What Is The Difference Between Local Storage, Session Storage
          </button>

            <strong>Local Storage:</strong> This read-only interface property
            provides access to the Documentâ€™s local storage object, the stored
            data is stored across browser sessions.As it is not session-based,
            it must be deleted via javascript or manually. Local storage has 4
            methods:
            <ol>
              <li>1.localStorage.setItem(key, value)</li>
              <li>2.localStorage.getItem(key)</li>
              <li>3.localStorage.removeItem(key)</li>
              <li>localStorage.clear()</li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <strong>Session Storage:</strong> Session Storage objects can be
            accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference
            between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data
            does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the
            page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a
            document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for
            only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time
            that the tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after the
            page reloads and restores.

            What Is The Difference Between Global Scope And Block Scope?

            <strong>Global Scope:</strong>
            The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are
            known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means
            that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program,
            any function or conditional state can access that variable. <br />
            <strong>Block Scope:</strong>
            The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside
            the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
            conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to
            refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}. Imagine
            a nested situation: A block of code enclosed with curly brackets{}
            containing some block variables.

            Placeholder content for this accordion, which is intended to
            demonstrate the <code>.accordion-flush</code> class. This is the
            third item's accordion body. Nothing more exciting happening here in
            terms of content, but just filling up the space to make it look, at
            least at first glance, a bit more representative of how this would
            look in a real-world application.
